            <h3>Political Unity</h3>
            <p>
                If India had never been partitioned, political unity would have
                resulted in a strong and inclusive federal system. The absence of
                border conflicts and regional disputes could have strengthened
                democratic institutions, improved governance, and allowed the
                government to focus on nation-building rather than military tensions.
                In a united India, a robust federal structure integrates princely states seamlessly 
                under leaders like Patel, balancing Hindu-majority and Muslim regions through proportional 
                representation and autonomies for Punjab and Bengal. No Indo-Pak wars save trillions 
                in defense spending, fostering stable coalitions and preventing Kashmir insurgencies, 
                though linguistic and regional tensions might test central authority.
            </p>
        `;

    else if (scenario === "Economic Growth") {
        result.innerHTML = `
            <h3>Economic Growth</h3>
            <p>
                A united India would have benefited from shared resources,
                integrated markets, and uninterrupted trade routes. Industrial
                growth would have accelerated through combined agricultural,
                mineral, and port resources, potentially positioning India as a
                global economic power much earlier in history.Combined resources 
                like Punjab's grains, Sindh's ports, and Bengal's jute enable 
                self-sufficient agriculture and textiles from day one, dodging 
                refugee crises and border trade barriers. Savings from absent 
                wars fuel dams, rails, and industries linking Karachi to Madras, 
                accelerating GDP growth to superpower levels by the 1980s, though 
                overpopulation strains per capita gains.

    else if (scenario === "Social Harmony") {
        result.innerHTML = `
            <h3>Social Harmony</h3>
            <p>
                Without partition, large-scale migration and communal violence
                could have been avoided. Cultural coexistence among different
                religions and communities might have strengthened national unity,
                promoted social stability, and fostered a shared identity across
                the subcontinent.Avoiding partition's 15 million displacements 
                and million deaths allows syncretic cultures to flourish—shared 
                Urdu-Hindi literature, interfaith festivals from Lahore to Lucknow, 
                and fluid migrations for education and jobs. Caste reforms and women's 
                literacy advance faster with undivided resources, but managing 400 
                million diverse people could spark caste or tribal agitations 
                without partition's divisions as a buffer.
