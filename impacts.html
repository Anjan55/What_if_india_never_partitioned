    <h2>Political Impact</h2>
    <p>A united India could have adopted a stronger federal system.
        A united India would forge a powerful federal democracy, 
        integrating diverse regions like Punjab and Bengal under 
        strong central leadership, likely averting Indo-Pak wars and Kashmir conflicts. 
        Military budgets slashed by trillions could fund infrastructure, 
        propelling India as a Cold War heavyweight rivaling China. 
        Internal power-sharing might prevent authoritarian drifts, 
        but regional separatisms in Balochistan or the Northeast could still erupt, 
        testing federal bonds.</p>

    <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
    <p>Unified markets and shared resources could have accelerated growth.A united India would avoid partition's economic scars, 
        like food grain shortages from lost fertile lands and jute/cotton deficits, boosting unified agriculture across Punjab 
        and Bengal for self-sufficiency. Industries such as textiles thrive without skilled labor flight or disrupted supply chains, 
        while ports like Karachi enhance exports, preventing India's early import dependency.
        Combined resources—Pakistan's gas, India's coal—could accelerate GDP growth, with estimates suggesting a 
        10-15% cumulative boost by dodging war costs and refugee strains. Infrastructure like Indus-Ganges canals 
        and seamless trade networks position this super-economy as a global leader by the 1980s, rivaling China sooner.
        Yet challenges persist: overpopulation strains (400M+ at independence) might slow per capita gains, and regional drags like arid areas could burden richer provinces without fiscal federalism. Overall, military savings (2-3% GDP yearly) fuel development, creating a powerhouse with 1.9B people by 2024</p>

    <h2>Social Impact</h2>
    <p>Reduced migration and communal violence.Communal riots displacing 15 million and killing a million are avoided, 
        fostering syncretic Hindu-Muslim cultures with shared festivals and intermarriages thriving across Lahore to 
        Lucknow. Urdu and regional languages blend in education, reducing divides, while migrations stay fluid for jobs. 
        Yet, caste tensions and linguistic agitations might intensify in a massive, diverse nation, potentially sparking social 
        upheavals without partition's "release valve." Women's rights and literacy could surge faster with unified resources, 
        creating a more cohesive yet fractious society.</p>
